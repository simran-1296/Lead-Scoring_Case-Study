# Lead-Scoring_Case-Study
The aim of the case study was build a model where we assign a lead score to between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot (most likely to convert) whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold.
